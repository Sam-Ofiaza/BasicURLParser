Project was imported and originally made for CS 3377 (Systems Programming in UNIX and Other Environments) with Professor Nhut Nguyen.

Thoughts: This was originally made for the command line in a Linux emulator for Windows (Linux Mint). The range of input follows the assignment description, which is very limited.
The program looks for only certain protocols, domains, and file paths. Ports and parameters were made optional. Use for actual URLs is not advised. The actual regex wasn't hard to
learn but required testing with a website.
